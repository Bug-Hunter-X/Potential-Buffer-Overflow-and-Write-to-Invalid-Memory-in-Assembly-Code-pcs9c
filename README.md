This repository contains an example of a potential buffer overflow and write to invalid memory bug in assembly code, along with its solution.  The bug is demonstrated in the `bug.asm` file and a corrected version is provided in `bugSolution.asm`. The vulnerability arises from the lack of bounds checking and validation of memory addresses.  The solution addresses this by implementing appropriate checks before memory access.
